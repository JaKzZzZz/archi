				<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>All of the original members of Architects grew up around Brighton, East Sussex and were very active within the local music scene prior to forming the band. Sam Carter, who was a drummer and studied drums at the Brighton Institute of Modern Music before joining the band, had performed in multiple local bands as a drummer and sometimes a singer; one of these bands had supported Enter Shikari in Brighton.</p>
				<p>Architects was founded in 2004 by drummer Dan Searle and his twin brother, guitarist Tom Searle. The project was called "Counting the Days" until it blossomed into what is now known as "Architects" with original vocalist Matt Johnson, guitarist Tim Hillier-Brook and Tim Lucas on bass guitar. In 2005, the band released a demo which would contain their first recorded material under the name of Architects. It was made available only for family and select friends, and a copy was later auctioned for charity in 2021.</p>

				<h2 class="major">Music</h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>Architects music has evolved significantly since their formation in 2004. Initially rooted in metalcore, their early albums like "Nightmares" (2006) and "Hollow Crown" (2009) showcased a heavier sound with aggressive riffs and breakdowns.</p>
				<p>Following the loss of guitarist Tom Searle in 2016, their sound matured further, as seen in "Holy Hell" (2018), which blended heaviness with emotional depth. Their latest album, "For Those That Wish to Exist" (2021), reflects a broader range of influences, including orchestral and electronic elements, while addressing contemporary social issues. This evolution highlights their ability to adapt and innovate within the metal genre.</p>
